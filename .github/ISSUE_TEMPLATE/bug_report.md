If this is for a new language or file type, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/alexgagnon/ttls/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first, as it provides a guide on how you can implement it yourself through a PR. Probably best to message me before you spend time on it to see if it makes sense to include in this library.

There is already a plan to get Intellisense working.
