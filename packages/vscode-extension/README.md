# TTL Helpers Extension

Right now this extension offers syntax highlighting for the `html`, `css`, and `xml` tagged template literals exported from the `ttl-helpers` library.

In the future the goal is to offer full Intellisense completions as well. 

[See notes](./NOTES.md) for an outline of how it works.
