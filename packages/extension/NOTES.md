# Notes of the Extension

Syntax highlighting is accomplished by providing additional Textmate grammars to VS Code, which are injected when specific RegExps are matched (e.g. `` html`<stuff>` ``, `` css`<stuff>` ``). See the `contributes.grammars` sections in `package.json`

Intellisense and code completion is much more involved... The current approach from Styled Components and Lit HTML extensions is to extend the TypeScript language server. It first detects the presence of a matching tagged template literal, e.g. `` html`<div></div>` ``, creates a virtual document of the contents in memory, hooks in the appropriate Language Server for that type (while extending these to support TL's interpolation `${}` syntax), extracts the Intellisense components it, and injects these back into the original document.
