# TTL Helpers

Consists of two packages:

- `lib` set of tagged template literals, which by themselves just act as normal template literals
- `vscode-extension` VS Code extension that provides format-specific Intellisense to the `ttl-helpers` exports

## TODO

- add intellisense
- add 'escaped'
- add 'safe': validated + escaped
- add trimming line starts
